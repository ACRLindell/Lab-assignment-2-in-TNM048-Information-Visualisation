TNM048 - Information Visualisation 
Assignment 2 Task 3 
The task for this part of the assignment was to make a scatterplot from scratch with a preferred programming 
language, we choose to write it in HTML5 and Javascript. 


How to run the files: 
Make sure to have the index.html and script.js in the same folder. 
Then run the index.html file and you will get up a browser window with a canvas area and a option to choose file to submit. 
Choose a csv-file from your directory and the press "Submit", now the data will be presented as a scatterplot. 
To choose a different csv-file for input you have to reload your tab or run the index.html file again.
